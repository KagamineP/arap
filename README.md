# ASUS Router Administration (Codename: Router Control)

This program was created to simplify the login to the admin panel on [ASUS](https://www.asus.com/) routers. This program requires a connection to the router via Wi-Fi or LAN. This program uses [CefSharp](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp), so the program loads the page http://router.asus.com/ (works only on ASUS routers). Ie, this program is a shortcut to access the administration panel. 

Auto-update function based on [AutoUpdater.NET](https://github.com/ravibpatel/AutoUpdater.NET).
